## What is Milestone Clip? ✨

Milestone Clip is a web app that turns your GitHub milestones into short, polished video clips. Enter a repository or GitHub username, pick a milestone type and a visual style, and get an MP4 you can post anywhere. Built for developers, maintainers, and open-source communities who want to share their wins without spending hours in an editor.

---

## Who is it for? 👋

- **Open-source maintainers** — celebrating repo stars or forks
- **Developers** — showcasing follower growth or total stars across their work

## Why I built this 💡

I kept hitting GitHub milestones—stars, forks, new followers—and wanted to share them in a way that looked good and didn’t take forever. Most options were either too generic, locked behind heavy subscriptions, or required real video-editing work. So I built something that’s **one input, one style choice, one download**: paste a repo or username, pick a look, and get a clip you can post in under a minute. Milestone Clip is that tool—for me and for anyone else who’s proud of their GitHub numbers and wants to show them off.

---

## Future / Open Source Promise 🌟

**If this repository reaches 10,000 GitHub stars, the entire Milestone Clip app will be fully open-sourced.**

That means the full codebase—frontend, backend, video compositions, billing integration, and deployment setup—will be released under an open-source license. No feature cuts, no “community edition” with crippled functionality. The goal is to grow the product with the community and then give it back when we hit that milestone. Your stars don’t just signal interest; they’re the trigger for making Milestone Clip fully open.
